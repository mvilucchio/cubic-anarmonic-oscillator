# cubic-anarmonic-oscillator

This repo contains many scripts I used to study the behaviour of the Cubic Anharmonic Oscillator.

These are the scripts used to produce the graphs for my small bachelor thesis. A *non-esaustive* explanation of the method used can be found in [my blog: Moller](https://superporchetta.github.io/2020/06/25/asymmetric-anarmonic-hoscillator.html "Moller Blog").

Also, as always, feel free to propose changes or improvements.
